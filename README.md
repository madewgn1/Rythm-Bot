## ‚ö† Warning

We created that for fun, we don't encourage you to use selfbots to create trouble on public servers and we won't do so.
## What is this shit ?

This project is a **Self Rythm Bot** in **[Node JS](https://nodejs.org/)**. It's made to do the same actions as **[Rythm](https://rythmbot.co/)**  while being a selfbot, this mean it can be used with a user account. This has many advantages, for example you can use it on any servers you're in, even without permissions.

You can use SelfRythm as a Docker container. To do so, you need to install Docker on your machine.
Create a Discord account and get the token
Then, you can run the command  
```sh
docker run -d \
--name "SelfRythm" \ # Optionnal, you can change it
-e "TOKEN=Your Discord Token" \ #Required
